# puremit

Experiment based on bobjflong's repository [Bobjflong](https://github.com/bobjflong/mithril-purescript-demo)

Which uses [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org/) and [Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/).


I am a beginner i Purescript, with no Mithril experience
But ill do my best to get something working (FFI may be horrible)
Having a Store would be nice, possibly State Monad
Long term goal would be to get super simple ajax, websocket, sessionstorage and token login working as i have in my thermdrag repository, halogen branch.

This ugly sample/experiment is using Zurb Foundation 6 right now, which i also decided to learn
